Seemingly unaware of your plans, Emily disappears into the bathroom. \n\nA quarter of an hour later, being sure that the aphrodisiac should've taken effect, you take a small peek. With a grin, you discover Emily sitting naked on the board, red in the face, squeezing her thighs while her fingers explore her privates. Quickly undressing yourself, you slip into the bathroom unnoticed, and approach Emily playing innocent. \n\n[color=yellow]— $master! I'm not…[/color]\n\nThe orphan girl seems to be completely shocked by your unannounced presence, her face getting even redder. Judging by the fact she is not screaming or trying to escape, you sense that she can't make up her mind on how to react, and quickly take things into your own hands. With a gentle, yet accusing voice, you tell her that you appreciate her arousal, but she can't just do what she pleases in her $master's home. Catching Emily in your trap, you make her believe that her behavior is entirely her own will and her lust is based off her desires.\n\nSeeing Emily accepting your manipulative words, you wrap your arm about her in an embrace, meeting no resistance. Despite being overwhelmed by the new situation, the aphrodisiac pumps through her veins and the orphan girl begins to awkwardly respond to your actions. As you greedily suck on her mouth, your hand hastily covers her soaking crotch, joining her own hand. With a small push, Emily shyly spreads her legs apart, giving you easier access. Stimulating her pussy, you slide a finger into her to discover she's clearly still a virgin, although that possibility had  already crossed your mind. \n\nAs she gets wetter and her moans get louder, you lay her on the bench and without further delay push your erect cock inside. The brief look of pain on her face is quickly washed away by pleasure as you begin to move within her. With every push the look on her face becomes more and more blissful, as she leans forward  trying to hug you. A few moments later she orgasms, and feeling her convulsions lead you to your own climax, filling her with hot seed. As you pull out, a stream of semen mixed with blood slowly seeps from her hard-breathing body. \n\nAfter helping her clean up, you leave the bathroom and get dressed once more.A few minutes later, she emerges from the bathroom red faced. She averts her eyes as you look at her, but you don't spot any negative feelings towards you. You leave her to get accustomed with her new role. ",

While your other hand lecherously savours her body, you let her know that even if she yells, nobody is going to come to her rescue, and her resistance will only make things worse. Tears begin to swell up in her eyes, but her attitude quickly reveals she understands her position.\n\nWith her acceptance, you decide to make the most of this little affair and grab her small boobs, squeezing them forcefully. Pulling on her nipples with clear intent to cause some pain, you delightedly listen to her small cries and observe her pained expression. Holding her squirming body, you push into her pussy, quickly meeting the resistance of her hymen. Pausing before you break through, you roughly rub her. Despite her pleading she begins to gets mildly wet at your administrations, which makes you grin. \n\nYou bend her over and push her against the wall. Emily sobs, seemingly preparing for what she knows comes next. \n\n[color=yellow]— Please stop, I don’t want this![/color]\n\nGrabbing her ass, you force your hard cock inside her virgin pussy in one thrust making her cry out in pain, as it tears through the slight resistance of her hymen. You pause, giving her barely enough time to recover, before resuming without any further concern for her well-being. Since she's not going to enjoy it anyway, you decide it's only humane to focus on your objective. Accompanied by her sobs and cries, you mercilessly fuck her tight pussy until you finally climax deep inside of her torn privates. \n\nLeaving her sobbing on the floor, your come mixed with blood oozing from her abused pussy, you advise her to take another shower. Satisfied, you make your way out of bathroom.",
